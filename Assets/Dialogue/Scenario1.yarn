BOSS: Look at you, you’re such a slow worker. STOP being a lazy ass!
CO-A: Boss, I’m trying my best. I worked overtime yesterday. I’m not in the best state today.

Do you want to help?
-> No
  You: CO-A, you’re not working hard enough, you got to up your game!
-> Yes 
  You: No boss, I’ve seen CO-A worked his ass off for you! You should be grateful to have a hard worker like him!
